## Three engines to render SVG (Delphi Image32, Skia4Delphi, Direct2D wrapper) and four components to simplify use of SVG images (resize, fixedcolor, grayscale...)

### Actual official version 4.2.0 (VCL+FMX)

| Component | Description |
| - | - |
| ![SVGIconImageCollectionComponentIcon.png](./Packages/SVGIconImageCollectionComponentIcon.png) | **TSVGIconImageCollection** is collection of SVG Images for Delphi to provide a centralized list of images for SVGIconVirtualImageLists (only for VCL) |
| ![SVGIconVirtualImageListComponentIcon.png](./Packages/SVGIconVirtualImageListComponentIcon.png) | **TSVGIconVirtualImageList** is a special "virtual" ImageList for Delphi linked to an SVGIconImageCollection (only for VCL) to simplify use of SVG Icons (resize, opacity, grayscale and more...) |
| ![SVGIconImageComponentIcon.png](./Packages/SVGIconImageComponentIcon.png) | **TSVGIconImage** is an extended Image component for Delphi (VCL+FMX) to show any SVG image directly or included into a an SVGIconImageList with all functionality (stretch, opacity, grayscale and more...) |
| ![SVGIconImageListComponentIcon.png](./Packages/SVGIconImageListComponentIcon.png) | **TSVGIconImageList** is an extended ImageList for Delphi (VCL+FMX) with an embedded SVG image collection: **the VCL component is deprecated**, we recommend to use SVGIconImageCollection + SVGIconVirtualImageList also for older Delphi versions! |

## Very important notice

WARNING: From version 4.0, **TSVGIconVirtualImageList** inherits from **TVirtualImageList** (using Delphi 10.3 to latest). For previous Delphi versions **TSVGIconVirtualImageList** inherits from **TSVGIconImageListBase**.

An important difference is that a TVirtualImageList may use and create only a subset of the images in the collection.

Although, the standard TVirtualImageList does not have the FixedColor, GrayScale, ApplyToRootOnly and Opacity properties, these properties exist at the TSVGIconImageCollection and they would be reflected on the linked TVirtualImageList, but if you change those properties at collection level, all the VirtualImageList linked changes!

For this reasons, now TSVGIconVirtualImageList have also FixedColor, GrayScale, ApplyToRootOnly and Opacity properties, so you can setup those properties only at VirtualImageList level, and you can share the same TSVGIconImageCollection from many VirtualImageList with different poperties, as you can see in the new SVGIconVirtualImageListDemo.

So, if you are using those components from Delphi 10.3, the recommended combination should be **TSVGIconImageCollection + TSVGIconVirtualImageList**.

Don't forget also the importance of PreserveItems when you have a large ImageCollection with many linked Actions. Without setting this property to "True", everytime you add or remove an icon in the collection, you have to check and change the ImageIndex of all the Actions.

Another feature available from Delphi 10.4 version, is that **TSVGIconImageCollection** inherits from TCustomImageCollection, so you can also use it with the TVirtualImage component and place SVG icons into the TControlList component, as explained [here...](https://github.com/EtheaDev/SVGIconImageList/wiki/TControlList-with-SVGIconImageCollection)

## Choose your preferred SVG engine!

There are three implementation:

- **Native Delphi Image32** (default), uses Image32 library by Angus Johnson

- Using **Skia4Delphi** library, a cross-platform 2D graphics API based on Google's Skia Graphics Library

- A wrapper to the native Windows **Direct2D** implementation

You can read more details [here.](https://github.com/EtheaDev/SVGIconImageList/wiki/Choice-of-Factories)

## Performance comparison

This table shows the performance of the three rendering engines tested with SVGExplorer, using a significant amount of icons from different sets, rendered at 128x128 pixels.

Count | Icon set        | Image32 |    D2D |Skia4Delphi|
  --: | :--             |     --: |    --: |     --:   |
 997  | Font-Awesome    |  1265ms | 1453ms |  1172ms   |
 654  | Papirus         |  2750ms<sup>(1)</sup> |  937ms | 1266ms<sup>(1)</sup> |
5366  | Material-Design | 11015ms | 12001ms | 10688ms   |

As you can see, the three engines perform differently depending on the icons and their complexity.

<sup>(1)</sup>Notice that Image32 and Skia4Delphi are the only engines capable of rendering blur effect (that is always slow to calculate): this is the reason of "slow" performance to render Papirus icons that contains blur effect.

### Available from Delphi XE3 to Delphi 12 (VCL and FMX Platforms)

### UTILITIES

The [SVG Viewer Demo](https://github.com/EtheaDev/SVGIconImageList/wiki/SVG-Viewer-(VCL)) is useful to check the rendering quality of the engines available.

The [SVG Icon Explorer](https://github.com/EtheaDev/SVGIconImageList/wiki/SVGIconExplorer) utility is useful to explore and preview your svg image collections.

You can use [SVG Shell Extensions](https://github.com/EtheaDev/SVGShellExtensions) if you want to see your icons directly into Windows Explorer or you want to edit them using a powerful **SVG Text Editor**.

### DOCUMENTATION

Follow the [guide in Wiki section](https://github.com/EtheaDev/SVGIconImageList/wiki) to known how to use those components to modernize your Delphi VCL or FMX Windows applications scalable, colored and beautiful with few lines of code.
