        "Stone, is it?" Scraps, who was again dancing wildly around, for she never tired and could never keep still for long.<tbreak/>
        "Course it's stone," answered Betsy scornfully.<tbreak/>
        "Can't you see?"<tbreak/>
        "Yes," said Scraps, going closer.  "I can SEE the wall, but I can't FEEL it."  And then, with her arms outstretched, she did a very queer thing.  She walked right into the wall and disappeared.<tbreak/>
        "For goodness sake!" Dorothy, amazed, as indeed they all were.<tbreak/>
        "The gates must be around the other side," said the Wizard.  "Let us follow the curve of the wall until we reach an opening in it."<tbreak/>
        "Which way?" asked Dorothy.<tbreak/>
        "We must guess that," he replied.  "Suppose we go to the left.  One direction is as good as another."  They formed in marching order and went around the city wall to the left.  It wasn't a big city, as I have said, but to go way around it outside the high wall was quite a walk, as they became aware.  But around it our adventurers went without finding any sign of a gateway or other opening.  When they had returned to the little mound from which they had started, they dismounted from the animals and again seated themselves on the grassy mound.

        The others of the party, however they might be puzzled by the serious problem that confronted them, would not allow themselves to despair.<tbreak/>
        "If we once get over these mountains," said Button-Bright, "we could probably get along all right."<tbreak/>
        "True enough," agreed Dorothy.  "So we must find some way, of course, to get past these whirligig hills.  But how?"<tbreak/>
        "I wish the Ork was with us," sighed Trot.<tbreak/>
        "But the Ork isn't here," said the Wizard, "and we must depend upon ourselves to conquer this difficulty.  Unfortunately, all my magic has been stolen, otherwise I am sure could easily get over the mountains."<tbreak/>
        "Unfortunately," observed the Woozy, "none of us has wings.  And we're in a magic country without any magic."<tbreak/>
        "What is that around your waist, Dorothy?" asked the Wizard.<tbreak/>
        "That?  Oh, that's just the Magic Belt I once captured from the Nome King," she replied.

        "A Magic Belt!   Why, that's fine.  I'm sure a Magic Belt would take you over these hills.".<tbreak/>
        "It might if I knew how to work it," said the little girl.  "Ozma knows a lot of its magic, but I've never found out about it.  All I know is that while I am wearing it, nothing can hurt me.".<tbreak/>
        "Try wishing yourself across and see if it will obey you," suggested the Wizard..<tbreak/>
        "But what good would that do?" asked Dorothy.  "If I got across, it wouldn't help the rest of you, and I couldn't go alone among all those giants and dragons while you stayed here.".<tbreak/>
        "True enough," agreed the Wizard sadly.  And then, after looking around the group, he inquired, "What is that on your finger, Trot?".<tbreak/>
        "A ring.  The Mermaids gave it to me," she explained, "and if ever I'm in trouble when I'm on the water, I can call the Mermaids and they'll come and help me.  But the Mermaids can't help me on the land, you know, 'cause they swim, and--and--they haven't any legs.".<tbreak/>
        "True enough," repeated the Wizard, more sadly.
