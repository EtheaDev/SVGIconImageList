      <p>Testing 'textArea' with fixed 'width' and 'height'</p>
      <p>
        Lines should break at character boundaries if there is not enough room to perform word breaks.
        The 'height' of the first 'textArea' below (top-right) is less than that of the characters
        so nothing should appear.

      <p>The text is taken from "The Lost Princess of Oz" by Baum, L. Frank (Lyman Frank), 1856-1919</p>
