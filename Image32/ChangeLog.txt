Recent changes:

Version 4.6 
* This release contains many bug fixes (see issues #10..#101) in the 
GitHub repository.
* Andreas Hausladen has also made multiple contributions to
the library that that have very significantly improved its performance.

      two published properties - AllowKeyScroll & AllowScrnScroll
      **Because of this Image32's runtime and designtime packages
      (Img32_Library.dpk & Img32_VCL_Dsgn.dpk) should be reinstalled.**

Version 3.2
  Img32.Layers
    * This unit has again been rewritten where all layers 
    can now contain other layers (in a tree like structure 
    under TLayeredImage32's Root layer).
    * The TGroupLayer32 remains but is intended only as a
    fully transparent container for other layers rather than 
    being a fully or even partially opaque surface to other layers.
    * TLayer32 Bounds are now relative to their Parent such 
    that moving a layer will automatically move all contained 
    children.
    * The Layers301 sample application demonstrates new features.
  Img32.FMX
    The DpiAwareFMX function replaced by the DpiAware function
    
Version 3.1
  Img32

      again to emulate Delphi's TSize field naming
    add RectsOverlap function
    add a UnionRect function that replaces the same function
      in Delphi's Types unit. (The function in the Types unit
      incorrectly unions empty rects which was causing problems)
  Img32.Extra
    fixed incorrect rotation angle in Draw3D function
  Img32.Layers
    added TLayer32.Move method
    changed TLayer32 Tag property to UserData property
    Added TGroupLayer32.ClipPath property

Version 2.02
  Minor updates to several Example applications.

Version 2.01
  Fixed a significant bug in Image32_Ttf.

Version 2.0
  This is a major update. There are many changes (mainly 
  to the Image32_Layers unit), and some of these changes 
  are very likely to break your existing code. Sorry.
  
  The Image32_Layers unit has been completely rewritten.
  The old unit was poorly written and cumbersome to use.
  The most significant change in the new layers unit is the 
  use of nested groups of layers that form a tree structure
  under TLayeredImage32.Root. This structure provides several
  advantages over the old flat layer structure. These include
  faster merges, and much simpler control over layer groups.
  Hit-testing has also been dramatically improved, being
  both much simpler to setup, and faster at detecting the 
  correct layer.
  
  The Image32_Text unit that was deprecated has been removed. 
  The Image32_Ttf unit provides all the functionality of the 
  old Image32_Text unit but, unlike its predecessor, supports 
  cross-platform development.
  
  Other units have had attention with minor bug fixes and 
  assorted embellishments, including a significant code tidy
  of the esoteric Image32_SmoothPath unit.

  The sample applications have also had significant revision.
  Some overly complicated apps have been removed, while others
  have been rewritten and simplified.

  The documentation has also been updated to address most if
  not all these changes.
